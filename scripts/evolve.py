"""
Evolve loop shipped inside every generated skill as scripts/evolve.py.

One command that closes the maintenance loop from the skill's own root:

    python3 scripts/evolve.py            # detect -> record -> re-verify
    python3 scripts/evolve.py --judge    # also grade llm-judge criteria
    python3 scripts/evolve.py --correct "<what the skill got wrong>"

Steps (default mode):
  1. staleness_check --check-deps --check-drift --record
     (review-interval, dependency health, schema drift; failures append raw
     evidence to EVOLUTION.md)
  2. run_evals --rollout [--judge]
     (runs the skill on its golden inputs; command checks + baseline regression
     gate + optional pinned judge; failures append raw evidence to EVOLUTION.md)

`--correct` is a different kind of input, and the most valuable one this loop
takes. Steps 1 and 2 catch what a machine can check: dates, reachability, output
drift. They cannot catch the class of knowledge that only exists in someone's
head -- the region that files late, the code that means something local, the
month the process runs differently.

That knowledge is not obtainable by asking up front. People cannot articulate a
workflow they run from muscle memory, which is why this factory reads artifacts
instead of interviewing. But the same person who could not describe the rule will
recognize its violation instantly, the moment the skill produces something wrong.
`--correct` is the capture point for that moment: it takes the sentence they would
have said out loud, writes it verbatim to EVOLUTION.md as evidence, and adds it to
the skill's `## Gotchas` so the next run already knows.

Exit codes:
    0 - fresh and green (or: correction recorded)
    1 - one or more steps failed; EVOLUTION.md holds the evidence
    2 - bad usage
